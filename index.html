                <p class="trip-description">My girlfriend and I are planning an eventual trip to Bora Bora, which she has always dreamed of
                    since she was a child. We are excited to see the crystal clear waters and the beautiful beaches, along with staying in a hut
                    over the water. We are also excited to try the local cuisine and see the local wildlife including Blacktip Reef Sharks and
                    Lemon Sharks.

                <p class="trip-description">We are also planning a trip to San Fransisco where we would like to visit a number of museums,
                    including the Exploratorium and the California Academy of Sciences. We are also excited to see the Golden Gate Bridge and
                    Alcatraz Island, as well as the unique nightlife in the city. In addition, we would like to get tattoos done at one of the
                    iconic tattoo parlors in San Fransisco, either Black Serum, Moth and Dagger, or Gold Leaf Ink.

                <p class="trip-description">The final trip on our current itinerary is the Netherlands, where my mom's side of the family originates.
                    We would really like to visit the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Musuem to see some of the finest art from the 18th and 19th centuries, 
                    as well as go on a romantic canal cruise to see the various sights of the city. We would also like to Heineken Brewery and the Vondelpark,
                    which is the largest park in Amsterdam with beautiful tulips of all colours.
